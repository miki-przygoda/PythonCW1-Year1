# 🧬 Family Tree Management System

This project is a Python-based, terminal interface (TUI) application that simulates a simplified family tree manager. Built as part of my first-year coursework in Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence at the University of Greenwich, it demonstrates core principles of object-oriented programming, CLI interaction, and structured data modeling.

## 🎯 What This Project Covers

- Custom class hierarchy for modeling family members and their relationships
- Clean terminal menu system with multiple view/query modes
- Logic-based calculations (e.g., listing siblings, cousins, age-based queries)
- Command-line parsing and user interaction
- Modularized architecture using Python modules and functions

> 📚 *This project helped me understand how abstract relationship logic can be turned into structured algorithms — from defining a "cousin" to calculating the oldest living family member.*

## ⚙️ Features

- [x] Track and register individuals with name, birth year, and gender
- [x] List siblings, cousins, and other direct relationships
- [x] Display birthdays, age ranges, or most recent births
- [x] Show people born in specific centuries or ranges
- [x] Modular menu system with clean CLI navigation

> 🚧 *Some advanced features such as grandparent tracking are planned but were outside the scope of this initial coursework release.*

## 🧠 Reflections & Next Steps

If I had more time, I'd expand this system into:

- A Flask-based API with a browser interface
- Support for family tree export/import (e.g., CSV or JSON)
- Visual family tree generation using `Graphviz` or `networkx`
- Integration of parent–grandparent logic for deeper ancestry queries

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.11  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- CLI Navigation / User Input Handling  
- Modular Python Scripting
